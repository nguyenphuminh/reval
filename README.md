## What is Reval.js?
Reval.js is an experimental, React-like front-end library used to create small-scale web apps faster and better-structured. It is light-weight (weighs less than 2KB), has no virtual dom, easy to learn and setup. You can just pull it from a CDN without having to install any dependecies or runtime environment.

You can also build your own front-end library from Reval, since its codebase is very small and easy to understand.
