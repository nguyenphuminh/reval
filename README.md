## What is Reval.js?

Reval.js is just a fun experimental project built to be one of the lightest front end libraries out there, don't use it for anything useful.

## What does it have?

* Functions to create/render HTML elements.
* Components with states and lifecycle events support.

Yeah that's it.

## What doesn't it have?

* Scalability and speed for any big, practical apps.

## Comparison

Just for fun, let's have a comparison in size with other light-weight libraries.

* Alpine.js: 14 kb gzipped.
* Petite-Vue: 6.9 kb gzipped.
* Lucia.js: 2 kb gzipped.
* Reval.js: 0.37 kb gzipped.
