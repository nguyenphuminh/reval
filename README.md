## What is Reval.js?
Reval.js is an experimental, React-like front-end library used to create small-scale web apps faster and better-structured. It is light-weight (0.5KB), has no virtual dom, easy to learn and setup. You can just pull it from a CDN without having to install any dependecies or runtime environment.

You can also build your own front-end library from Reval, since its codebase is very small and easy to understand.

## Philosophies
Reval.js is build under these philosophies:
* Frameworks/libraries must be light-weight, with no BS dependencies - Reval weighs only 0.5KB minified + gzipped with no dependencies.
* Small-scale apps should be fast, easy to build and maintain - Reval is fast for small-scale apps, easy to learn and use (you can learn Reval in 10 minutes).
* Easy to setup and install - No runtime environment is required to run Reval apps, it is 100% optional.
* Easy to switch to another libraries - It is easy to port a Reval codebase to a React-or-any-React-like-framework codebase.

## Size comparison with other frameworks
| Size               | Reval       | Vue         | React       | Angular           |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Minified & Gzipped | **0.5 KB**  | 33.4 KB     | 31.8KB      | 111KB             |

## Is it ready?
Kind of, but its performance and scalabiltiy have remained untested.
